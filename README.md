# CMC MSU course "Methods and Tools of Information Retrieval"

This repository contains the results of my work during the course **"Methods and Tools of Information Retrieval."** The course explores the fundamentals and advanced techniques used in modern information retrieval systems and natural language processing.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Search Engine Basics**. Query processing, ranking models (Boolean, vector space, probabilistic), PageRank, and relevance feedback.
- **Text Representation and Classification**. Word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT, GPT), classical methods (Bayesian, k-NN, SVM), and other neural approaches (RNNs, CNNs).
- **Automatic Annotation and Summarization**. Techniques for generating extractive and abstractive summaries, evaluation metrics like ROUGE.
- **Evaluation Metrics**. Precision-recall, NDCG, and methods for assessing search and classification performance.
- **Cutting-Edge Tools**. Latent semantic analysis, thematic modeling, transformers, and the application of LLMs in information retrieval tasks.

## About This Repository

Throughout the course, I worked on assignments that allowed me to apply these concepts in practice. This repository showcases my learning journey and the projects I've completed as part of the course.
